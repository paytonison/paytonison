\begin{abstract}
A growing cohort of socially isolated young men learn intimacy and status through simulations---anime archetypes and livestreamed personas---and attempt to port those scripts into real life. When these scripts fail, some ricochet toward ideologies that promise mastery through domination rather than reciprocity. This paper synthesizes scholarship on parasocial interaction, \emph{hikikomori}, micro-celebrity labor, and engagement-optimized platforms to model a self-reinforcing loop (anime $\rightarrow$ streamer persona $\rightarrow$ viewer attachment $\rightarrow$ ideological substitution $\rightarrow$ algorithmic reinforcement). It then outlines where AI systems can interrupt the loop---not by supplying a shinier simulation, but by serving as training wheels for empathy---with design principles, metrics, guardrails, and a research agenda. Throughout, we stress a non-pathologizing stance toward neurodiversity: the harms discussed arise from incentive structures and isolation, not diagnosis.

\section{Introduction: From Scripts to Substitutes}

Horton and Wohl's foundational account of \emph{parasocial interaction} described a simulacrum of conversational give-and-take that requires little mutual obligation \cite{horton1956}. In the platform era, livestreaming collapses distance further: the audience types, the performer replies, and intimacy feels reciprocal while remaining asymmetrical \cite{taylor2018}.

Across the last two decades, anime tropes and streamer personas have fused into a cultural engine that manufactures stylized performances of affection, dominance, and desire. When isolated viewers import those scripts into reality and hit friction, a subset turns to ideological substitutes that promise control (e.g., the manosphere's prescriptive ``manhood acts'') \cite{ging2019}. Platforms---economically tuned to reward high-arousal engagement---then amplify what performs best, not what heals best \cite{berger2012,zuboff2019,wu2016}.

Our thesis is not that anime ``causes'' misogyny or that streaming creates alienation. Rather: simulation displaces practice when economic and social conditions starve people of safe, reciprocal interaction. The result is a feedback loop that monetizes loneliness.

\section{Conceptual Grounding}

\subsection{Parasociality, Updated}
Horton and Wohl's account now operates in a ``one-and-a-half-sided'' mode on Twitch and similar platforms: viewers feel addressed through chat while remaining structurally peripheral \cite{horton1956,taylor2018}.

\subsection{\emph{Hikikomori} and Media Archetypes}
\emph{Hikikomori}---prolonged social withdrawal---was first documented in Japan and is now observed transnationally. Reviews and international investigations trace co-occurrence with mood and anxiety disorders and emphasize the role of social context \cite{teo2010,kato2012}. Media both reflects and packages isolation into exportable archetypes (e.g., idealized passivity or volatility), simplifying reciprocity into consumable beats. For a cultural analysis of database-driven character typologies that shaped ``otaku'' consumption, see Azuma \cite{azuma2009}.

\subsection{Micro-Celebrity as Performed Intimacy}
Streamers do not only play games; they perform affective labor: modulating flirtation and boundary, soliciting gifts, and sustaining plausibly personal ties. This is classic micro-celebrity work \cite{senft2008,marwickboyd2011}, now industrialized by live platforms \cite{taylor2018}.

\section{The Ouroboros Loop (A Systems View)}

\noindent\textbf{Narrative overview.} We model two dominant reinforcing loops:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{R1 (Engagement).} Archetype clarity $\rightarrow$ higher arousal $\rightarrow$ more shares/recommendations $\rightarrow$ stronger archetypes \cite{berger2012}.
  \item \textbf{R2 (Compensation).} Social failure $\rightarrow$ ideological scripts promising control $\rightarrow$ renewed consumption $\rightarrow$ platform incentives to surface similar content \cite{ging2019,zuboff2019,wu2016}.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Manosphere as Ideological Substitution}

When simulated intimacy fails, doctrine replaces dialogue. Ging \cite{ging2019} maps the manosphere's repertoire (alphas, betas, incels) as performative masculinity optimized for virality and merchandise funnels. These ``decoded reality'' scripts translate hurt into domination rituals, offering control in place of reciprocity.

\section{The Economic Substrate: Attention as Asset Class}

Platforms are paid to predict and capture arousal. Empirical work finds that high-arousal emotions (awe, anger, anxiety) increase sharing; engagement-based ranking therefore favors content that spikes those states \cite{berger2012}. Zuboff's account of surveillance capitalism and Wu's history of attention markets describe an economy in which intimacy is simulated because simulation scales, while reciprocity does not \cite{zuboff2019,wu2016}.

\section{Where AI Can Interrupt (Not Amplify) the Loop}

AI will either double down on simulation (virtual companions, auto-streamers) or scaffold users back to reciprocity. The latter requires reframing conversational agents as \emph{practice partners} that reward connection skills, not conquest.

\subsection{Evidence That Practice Agents Can Shape Behavior}
Early systems show that interactive practice plus feedback can shape social behavior:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A randomized controlled trial with a CBT-based conversational agent (Woebot) reduced depressive symptoms in young adults over two weeks \cite{fitzpatrick2017}.
  \item Automated conversation coaches and social-skill trainers improved specific conversational behaviors and confidence \cite{hoque2013,bickmore2009}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Principles for Empathy-Training AI}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{P\arabic*}.]
  \item \textbf{Optimize for reciprocity, not retention.} Define a ``reciprocity score'' (balanced turns, clarification questions, repair attempts, explicit consent checks) and tune policies against it.
  \item \textbf{Mirror tone in real time.} Provide immediate, non-shaming feedback (e.g., ``That phrasing may land as contempt; try curiosity.'').
  \item \textbf{Drill ambiguity and repair.} Use graduated tasks that require reading subtext, negotiating boundaries, and repairing misunderstandings.
  \item \textbf{Model consequences and memory.} Persistent state: breaches reduce trust; repair raises it---teaching the cost of callousness.
  \item \textbf{Prevent parasitic attachment.} Caps on daily minutes and prompts to practice with humans, so bots do not become a new crutch.
  \item \textbf{Guard against grooming.} Detect grievance rhetoric and redirect into evidence-based reflection, not performative debate.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A Constructive vs.\ Destructive Pattern Library}
\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Destructive use of AI} & \textbf{Constructive alternative} \\
    \midrule
    AI ``companions'' that condition dependence on scripted affection & Empathy rehearsal with off-platform missions; the bot ``levels up'' only when the user reports real-world practice \\
    Recommenders that optimize for time-on-platform & Recommenders that weight reciprocity proxies (turn-taking, low-toxicity, consent clarity) \\
    Trope generators that recycle dominance/idealization & Narrative tools that reward mutuality, repair, and perspective-taking \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{AI can amplify simulation or scaffold reciprocity, depending on design.}
\end{table}

\section{Risks and Ethics}

\textbf{Simulated empathy addiction.} If the bot is too soothing, it becomes another parasocial sink; require ``social transfer'' objectives.\\
\textbf{Ableist misuse.} Support neurodiverse users without pathologizing difference; offer multiple communication styles.\\
\textbf{Privacy and safety.} Interpersonal training data are intimate; minimize retention and enable local inference when feasible.\\
\textbf{Measurement gaming.} If reciprocity scores gate rewards, users may min-max politeness; combine metrics with human-rated audits.

\section{Policy and Platform Levers}

The EU Digital Services Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/2065) compels very large platforms to assess systemic risks and open data to researchers \cite{dsa2022}. The UK's Online Safety Act strengthens age-assurance and a duty of care for online services \cite{osa2023}. Both regimes can be used to pilot well-being--optimized feeds and auditing of parasocial amplification.

\section{Testable Claims}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{H\arabic*}.]
  \item If a cohort of isolated men receives eight weeks of AI-mediated empathy practice with off-platform missions, then (a) reciprocity scores in blind human conversations will improve; (b) parasocial spending will decline relative to controls.
  \item If a platform shifts ranking weight from engagement to reciprocity-proxy signals in relationship content, then session depth on grievance channels will shrink, and creator personas will move toward warmer, less archetypal affect to retain audience.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

Simulated intimacy is easier to scale and monetize than the messy reciprocity humans actually need. Anime gave a grammar; streamers turned that grammar into a business; algorithms industrialized the result. Some viewers, denied real feedback and belonging, graduate from scripts of affection to scripts of domination. We will not inspire our way out of an engine designed for arousal capture. But we can (1) re-price incentives through policy and audit, and (2) build AI that trains for empathy rather than merely performing it. The former constrains the ouroboros; the latter gives people new social muscles.

\section*{Note on Neurodiversity}

Literalist or script-driven social behavior must not be conflated with autism writ large. Autism is a neurotype, not a moral deficit. The harms discussed here arise from market incentives and isolation; any proposed interventions should be co-designed with neurodiverse communities.
