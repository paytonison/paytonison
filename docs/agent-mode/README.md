# Agent Mode Documentation

**Maintainer:** Payton Ison  
**Repository Section:** `/docs/agent-mode/`  
**Purpose:** To document behavioral characteristics, synchronization patterns, and best practices for ChatGPT Atlas **Agent Mode** operations.

---

## Overview
This directory contains notes, observations, and internal best-practice documents for improving workflow efficiency and stability when using Atlas Agent Mode.

Agent Mode enables real-time interaction between the AI and the browser environment. Because the AI operates on a separate context bridge, small synchronization gaps can occur between what the user sees and what the model perceives. These documents outline ways to detect, understand, and mitigate such behavior.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **2025-10-31-context-lag-mitigation.md** | Documents the ~3-second synchronization delay between the user’s browser and the assistant context. Includes mitigation steps and restart-avoidance guidelines. |
| **README.md** | This file. Provides structure, intent, and usage for the `agent-mode` documentation. |

## Usage Guidelines
- Always wait **3–5 seconds** after issuing a navigation or posting command before assuming a failure.
- When in doubt, **trust the user’s live state** over the model’s perceived one.
- Contribute new notes by appending Markdown files here, following the naming format:  
  `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md` (e.g., `2025-11-01-context-propagation.md`).

---

## Contribution Notes
- All files should include:
  - **Title**
  - **Date**
  - **Author**
  - **Environment Context**
  - **Reproduction Steps (if applicable)**
- Use concise Markdown formatting and emphasize reproducible cases over speculation.

---

## Future Additions
- **Error Recovery Playbook:** Automatic handling for failed agent tasks mid-action.  
- **Multi-Agent Coordination Notes:** Describing simultaneous browser-tab control.  
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Latency and context desync under load.
