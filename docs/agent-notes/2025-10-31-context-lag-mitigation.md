# Agent Mode Best-Practice: Context Lag Mitigation

**Author:** Payton Ison  
**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Environment:** ChatGPT Atlas (Agent Mode)

---

## Observation
Agent mode in Atlas shows a consistent synchronization delay—roughly **3 seconds**—between the **user’s live browser state** and the **assistant’s contextual awareness** of that state.

This delay manifests as a mismatch between what the user sees (e.g., a page fully loaded) and what the assistant perceives (e.g., “page not loaded” errors).

---

## Impact
When the assistant misinterprets this lag as a true failure, it can:
- Restart a process already in progress  
- Duplicate navigation or posting actions  
- Extend overall task completion time  

These false negatives occur because the assistant reacts before the page context bridge completes its update cycle.

---

## Recommended Practice
1. **Pause 3–5 seconds** after any command that changes browser state before retrying or issuing a follow-up.
2. **Avoid reissuing** identical commands unless confirmed failure is observed (e.g., persistent 404/timeout).
3. **Trust user confirmation** when they report the page is loaded; defer to the live environment view.

📜 **Logged for:** Internal best-practice refinement in Atlas agent behavior.

## Notes
This guideline ensures smoother multi-step actions (posting, form submission, navigation) by aligning temporal context between the assistant and the Atlas environment.
