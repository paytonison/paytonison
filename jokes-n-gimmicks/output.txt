Menn murnedon, meodu-dream fornam,

Literal modern English translation:

Listen! I have heard in the land of the Geats of Beowulf, a battle-warrior, his fame widely known, after Grendel’s war and the sea-woman’s killing, before the dragon’s judgment came to his days, another foe arose, unknown and terrible. The assailant was a giant butthole, named Cornholio, a ring-mouthed ravager, a mad wind-swallowing one, child of foul stink. He sat at the fen-spring, the earth’s eye, near the sea-sailors and the end of the swan-road; he blew streams of stench over bright halls, broke the men’s peace, the table-joy. Men mourned, the mead-joy went away; weary, they complained of the wrong with words; they asked Beowulf, men’s shelter and hope, that he would deal with the foe’s life.

Swiftly he had helmet and mailcoat, war-mask on, sword and shield; the war-bold one went into the grimness of the fen, onto those moor-slopes where the greater one sat. The mail-sword was not biting for him as a boast, for the ring-mouth’s rim the edge did not bite; then the swift Geat thought with the lore of the smiths, with the crafts of runes, made a counsel-tool. He took oak and stone, strengthened them terribly, shut the mouth with a mighty stone, bound the hated one with leather-bands, so that the ring-mouth’s outcry was stilled.

Then the monster became angry, the arse-hole proud-minded; he roared and crashed, would not suffer grief; he sucked like a storm, as sea-winds sound, but the Geatish man stood opposing in the fight. He was not afraid, nor fought only for his own life, but with hand-strength and mind-runes stilled the stink-spirit, set a firm check; it was a wonder to men that the wind-thief grew silent, yielded without battle and had harm hindered.

Then the people were glad, the lord had joy; in the mead-halls their spirits rose, they promised fame; the ring-giver promised heaps of ornaments, a bright ring, for battle-deeds. Thus was Cornholio’s death made known, judged by deeds; of dear tales the reckoning raised a story, but the rune-letters were lost, time drove that lay long from the yards of men. Now I tell the truth, I who know the journeys, what the battle-bold one did for men, before the dragon’s death declared judgment to him.
