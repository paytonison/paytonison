## üëã About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm **Payton Ison** ‚Äî writer, philosopher, AI developer, and polymath. My journey has spanned Physics and Computer Science (double-major), History (AA, Cum Laude), Creative Writing, Philosophy, Film, and, most recently, pushing the boundaries of AI.

- **Innovator**: Developed a human-led, recursive, reinforcement learning method that‚Äôs achieved unprecedented success with Google Gemini and OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT models.
- **Wordsmith**: My mastery of English (Old, Middle, and Modern) and dyslexia let me develop novel prompt engineering and wordcraft techniques.
- **Philosopher**: The linchpin behind my work, shaping both thinking and doing. Philosophy unlocks the mind; the universal key to cognition.
- **Experimenter**: I build prototypes that range from micro-AGI (trained for just $10 on a proprietary dataset) to a therapist AGI-in-progress using the OpenAI API.
- **Writer**: My short novella, written during my final semester before leaving academia for AI, is my literary Gesamtkunstwerk ‚Äî check it out in my [repositories](https://github.com/paytonison?tab=repositories).

## üöÄ Featured Projects

- **[Micro-AGI (Muse)](https://github.com/paytonison/muse)**: Trained with minimal resources, demonstrating the power of creative, writer-led reinforcement learning.
- **[Therapist AGI](https://github.com/paytonison/therapy-bot)**: An ongoing project using the OpenAI API to develop an empathetic, conversational agent used as a supplemental aid for human therapists to administer triage treatment for mild- to moderate-level situations.
- **[1914](https://github.com/paytonison/1914)**: My literary magnum opus, crafted during my academic transition.
- **[LLM Mario Agent](https://github.com/paytonison/llm-mario-agent)**:  What does Payton do when he‚Äôs bored? He builds a bridge between embodied cognition and disembodied LLMs using `pygame`, structured game state, and GPT inference loops. This prototype connects a custom-built Mario platformer to GPT-4 via a structured JSON state encoder, turning game entities (coins, goombas, the flagpole of destiny) into readable tokens for real-time decision-making. The result? A synthetic agent that ‚Äúplays‚Äù the game through text-to-action mapping‚Äîno camera, no hands, just pure cognition. It‚Äôs part toy, part research artifact, and a whole lot of fun.  
Use cases span:
- LLM reinforcement learning environments
- Sensorimotor feedback testing for AI alignment
- Embodied cognition simulations
- Prompt-tuned control via game state abstraction

## About This Repository‚Äôs Workflow

**Notice**:
This repository is part of an ongoing, publicly-visible development process. Code changes, refactors, and upgrades are implemented and tested locally with the assistance of AI tools (including GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT), but commits and pushes only happen when I‚Äôm fully confident in their stability, purpose, and improvement.

---

### *My Commit Philosophy*

* Deliberate Commits:
I do not commit/push every change as I go. Instead, I work iteratively, often in long local branches, only updating the public repo after extensive testing, review, and reflection.

* Copilot & AI Integration:
As a dyslexic who has difficulty with spatial sequencing (sometimes called spatial counting or tracking), I use tools like Copilot and ChatGPT as accessibility aids. They reduce cognitive friction when writing, editing, and debugging code; however, ***all logic, design, and conceptual direction come directly from me.***
AI as a prosthetic, not a pilot: The AI helps clarify syntax, fill gaps, and catch errors that are otherwise challenging due to my neurotype.
*  Human-in-the-loop: No code is ever committed blindly. Every algorithm, architectural decision, or structural choice is my own; AI is used to accelerate, not dictate, the process.
*  Final review: All commits are reviewed, tested, and validated by me before being pushed, regardless of AI input.
* Resilience & Rollback:
Sometimes, things break. When experiments go sideways, I may roll back local changes, restore from previous clones, or even re-download folders before pushing stable updates. You might see evidence of this in commit histories or branch structures.
*  Transparency & Learning:
This repo is a living record of my skills evolving in real time. By keeping my projects public, I‚Äôm inviting others to see not just the polished final product, but the actual journey‚Äîsuccesses, refactors, and recoveries included.

### *Why This Matters*
* You may notice fewer ‚Äúmicro-commits‚Äù or work-in-progress branches compared to other public projects. This is intentional. I prefer to keep history clean and focused, avoiding noise for reviewers, future collaborators, and myself.
* If you spot major refactors, sudden improvements, or style changes, that‚Äôs likely a reflection of adopting new tools, patterns, or AI-assisted suggestions that were first vetted offline.
