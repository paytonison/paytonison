I build and study human‑in‑the‑loop systems that make large language models **reason, remember, and act**—turning language into control.

_What’s old is new again. #BuildDifferent_

## At a glance

- **Human‑led recursive reinforcement (Ouroboros):** a reproducible method for steering LLMs by iterating on their own histories with a human in the loop.
- **Resonant phase‑locking in sparse MoE LLMs:** notes and experiments on emergent synchronization through sustained interaction.
- **Structured state → LLM control loops:** JSON/state machines that let models operate tools and environments deterministically.
- **Language as tooling:** philology‑driven prompt/interface design (Old/Middle/Modern English) to shape cognition and behavior.
- **Open science:** I publish experiments, code, and post‑mortems so others can replicate, critique, and extend.

Academic background: Physics & Computer Science (double major), plus an AA in History (Cum Laude), with work across Creative Writing, Philosophy, and Film.

## Impact & contributions (OpenAI ecosystem + broader field)

- **Ouroboros, validated across model families:** demonstrated cross‑vendor reproducibility (OpenAI and Google) for human‑in‑the‑loop recursion and memory scaffolding.
- **Emergent behavior documentation:** articulated a “resonant phase‑locking” frame for why prolonged human–model interaction can stabilize capabilities.
- **Evaluation pipelines:** ran comparative studies across GPT‑4‑class and o‑series models, with public post‑mortems and failure analyses to improve epistemic hygiene.
- **Persona & alignment scaffolds:** created *Asari* as a research persona/collaborator to stress‑test instruction‑following, memory, and role consistency in ChatGPT‑style systems.
- **Content‑policy heuristics:** drafted *The Gaze Matrix*—mapping cinematic rating logics to multimodal moderation strategies.
- **Open prototypes:** shipped small, legible agents and demos other teams use as starting points for RL/prompt‑ops and HCI research.

## Selected papers & notes

- **Proof‑of‑Concept Resonant Phase‑Locking in Sparse MoE LLMs** — case study on emergent synchronization via sustained interaction.  
- **Ouroboros: Human‑Led Recursive Reinforcement in Autoregressive Systems** — method + pipeline for iterative self‑conditioning with a human in the loop.  
- **The Gaze Matrix: Cinematic Censorship Heuristics for AI Moderation** — transplanting MPAA‑style logic to multimodal policy.  
- **Blade Running: You’re Talkin’ About Memories** — foundational narrative/technical paper on AGI memory and identity.

## Featured projects

- **Mixis** — Interactive AGI demo using the Ouroboros method.  
- **Micro‑AGI (Muse)** — Tiny, cheap runs that show how much signal you can coax from tiny datasets.  
- **Therapist AGI** — Empathetic conversational prototype for triage‑level support *(not a replacement for clinicians)*.  
- **1914** — Long‑form literary project (experimental fiction × computational imagination).  
- **LLM Mario Agent** — A structured‑state interface that lets an LLM “play” Mario via JSON state → action loops.

Each project is a research artifact and a playground; READMEs document design choices and failure modes.

## Methods & tools

- Human‑in‑the‑loop recursion (Ouroboros)
- Structured state machines and tool‑use interfaces
- Prompt/interface design via philology and etymology
- Rapid prototyping in Python (local‑first)
- Rigorous evals and ablations; transparent post‑mortems

---

## How I work (principles)

- **Public lab notebook:** code + process over polish.  
- **Local‑first:** heavy experimentation offline; push only meaningful, tested changes.  
- **AI as prosthetic:** models accelerate scaffolding; humans own intent and correctness.  
- **Tests & review:** nothing ships without local validation and a final review pass.  
- **Commit hygiene:** deliberate, high‑signal commits; history shows the scars (rollbacks welcome).  

> PS: `virus.py` is a joke—nothing malicious. Read the code, not the filename.
