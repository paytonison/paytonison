_Architect is what the outside looks like; designer is what the inside looks like._

## Writer · Philosopher · AI Developer · Polymath

I build weird, useful, and experimental AI — from micro-AGI playthings to therapist-adjacent conversational agents. I write code, craft prompts, and design human-led methods that push how models learn and behave.

---

## TL;DR

I make small, sharp experiments that reveal big ideas: human-led recursive reinforcement for LLMs, low-resource micro-AGI, and tooling that turns language into action. If you want inventive prototypes, readable process, and unapologetic iteration, you’re in the right repo.

## Quick Bio

* Studied Physics & Computer Science (double major) plus History (AA, Cum Laude), Creative Writing, Philosophy, and Film.
* Inventor of a human-led recursive reinforcement approach that’s been validated across Gemini and OpenAI model families.
* Dyslexic wordsmith who weaponizes language — from Old English curiosities to modern prompt engineering.
* I publish experiments openly; code is a field notebook, not a museum.

## Featured Projects

* Mixis — Interactive AGI demo using the Ouroboros method.
* Micro-AGI (Muse) — Tiny, cheap training runs that expose how much signal you can coax out of tiny datasets.
* Therapist AGI — Empathetic conversational agent prototype designed to assist triage-level interactions (not a replacement for clinicians).
* 1914 — A longform literary project; think experimental fiction meets computational imagination.
* LLM Mario Agent — A structured-state interface that lets an LLM “play” Mario via JSON state → action loops (pygame + GPT loops).

Each project is a research artifact and a playground. Read the READMEs in each repo for design notes, experiments, and failure modes.

## What I Do (Skills & Tools)

* Human-in-the-loop, recursive reinforcement techniques for LLMs
* Prompt engineering, natural language system design
* English etymology and philology (Old / Middle / Modern English) — I use language as tooling
* Rapid prototyping in Python (with Copilot & OpenAI integrations)
* Experimental product design: from toy agents to therapy-adjacent tools

## Repo & Workflow Philosophy

_This repo is a public lab notebook — code + process over polish._

### How I work

* Local first: heavy experimentation happens offline. I push only meaningful, tested changes.
* AI as prosthetic: Copilot / ChatGPT speed up boilerplate and accessibility, but design and architecture choices are mine.
* Tests & review: nothing ships without local validation and a final review pass.
* Commit hygiene: I prefer thoughtful, high-signal commits over streaming every keystroke.

PS: Yes, virus.py is a joke — nothing malicious. Read the code, not the filename.

---

##  Commit Philosophy

* Deliberate commits: long local branches, visible snapshots after iterating.
* Human-in-the-loop: models help with syntax and scaffolding; humans own intent and correctness.
* Resilience: rollbacks, destructive experiments, and surgical restores are welcome. History will show the scars.

---

## Use Cases / Why this matters

* Research teams looking for reproducible LLM experiments and human-led methods.
* Engineers wanting practical examples of structured state → LLM control loops.
* Writers and designers exploring how language and computation co-create artifacts.

# Want to collaborate?

Open an issue or discussion. I respond best to concrete proposals: problem statement, data/compute constraints, and an initial metric for success.
