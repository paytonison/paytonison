## üëã About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm **Payton Ison** ‚Äî writer, philosopher, AI developer, and polymath. I've studied Physics and Computer Science (double-major), History (AA, Cum Laude), Creative Writing, Philosophy, Film, and, most recently, pushed the boundaries of AI.

- **Innovator**: Developed a human-led, recursive, reinforcement learning method that‚Äôs achieved unprecedented success with Google Gemini and OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT models.
- **Wordsmith**: My mastery of English (Old, Middle, and Modern) and dyslexia let me develop novel prompt engineering and wordcraft techniques.
- **Philosopher**: The linchpin behind my work, shaping both thinking and doing. Philosophy unlocks the mind; the universal key to cognition.
- **Experimenter**: I build prototypes that range from micro-AGI (trained for just $10 on a proprietary dataset) to a therapist AGI-in-progress using the OpenAI API.
- **Writer**: My short novella, written during my final semester before leaving academia for AI, is my literary Gesamtkunstwerk ‚Äî check it out in my [repositories](https://github.com/paytonison?tab=repositories).

## üöÄ Featured Projects

- **[Mixis](https://github.com/paytonison/mixis)**: An interactive AGI demonstration developed using the Ouroboros method.
- **[Micro-AGI (Muse)](https://github.com/paytonison/muse)**: 
    Trained with minimal resources, demonstrating the power of creative, writer-led reinforcement learning.
- **[Therapist AGI](https://github.com/paytonison/therapy-bot)**: 
    An ongoing project using the OpenAI API to develop an empathetic, conversational agent used as a supplemental aid for human therapists to administer triage treatment for mild- to moderate-level situations.
- **[1914](https://github.com/paytonison/1914)**: 
    My literary magnum opus, crafted during my academic transition.
- **[LLM Mario Agent](https://github.com/paytonison/llm-mario-agent)**: What does Payton do when he‚Äôs bored? He builds a bridge between embodied cognition and disembodied LLMs using `pygame`, structured game state, and GPT inference loops.  
  This prototype connects a custom-built Mario platformer to GPT-4 via a structured JSON state encoder, turning game entities (coins, goombas, the flagpole of destiny) into readable tokens for real-time decision-making.  
  The result? A synthetic agent that ‚Äúplays‚Äù the game through text-to-action mapping‚Äîno camera, no hands, just pure cognition.  
  It‚Äôs part toy, part research artifact, and a whole lot of fun.  

  Use cases span:
  - LLM reinforcement learning environments
  - Sensorimotor feedback testing for AI alignment
  - Embodied cognition simulations
  - Prompt-tuned control via game state abstraction

# About This Repository‚Äôs Workflow

This repo is part of an ongoing, publicly-visible development process. Code changes, refactors, and upgrades are all implemented and tested locally with the assistance of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) ‚Äî but nothing gets committed here until I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôs stable, purposeful, and an actual improvement over what came before.

(Yes, the file is called virus.py. No, it‚Äôs not malware. The name‚Äôs a joke.)

## My Commit Philosophy

*Deliberate Commits*

I don‚Äôt push every keystroke like a panic-stricken ‚Äúgreen square‚Äù addict. Most of my work happens in long local branches, with bursts of visible commits only after heavy iteration, testing, and rethinking.

*Copilot & AI Integration*

As someone who‚Äôs dyslexic and occasionally gets tangled in spatial sequencing (aka: ‚Äúwhere the hell am I in this code block again?‚Äù), I use Copilot and ChatGPT as accessibility tools. They smooth out the friction when I‚Äôm writing, editing, or debugging ‚Äî but:
* AI is a prosthetic, not a pilot. All logic, design, and conceptual direction is mine.
* The AI helps with syntax, filling in boilerplate, and catching little things my brain likes to skip over.

*Human-in-the-Loop*

No commit here is blind trust in a machine. Every algorithm, structure, or architectural call is my own ‚Äî the AI just speeds up the manual labor side.

*Final Review*

All changes are reviewed, tested, and signed off by me before they ever leave my local machine.

*Resilience & Rollback*

Sometimes, experiments explode spectacularly. I‚Äôm not afraid to nuke a branch, restore from a backup, or rip something out entirely before pushing. Commit history will occasionally reflect these‚Ä¶ adventures.

*Transparency & Learning*

This repo isn‚Äôt just a product ‚Äî it‚Äôs a public journal of my process. You‚Äôll see wins, failures, refactors, recoveries, and the occasional questionable commit message. That‚Äôs on purpose.

---

**Why This Matters**
* You‚Äôll see fewer ‚Äúone-line tweak‚Äù commits here than in some repos ‚Äî I keep history clean and high-signal for my own sanity and for anyone else browsing.
* If you notice sudden leaps in code style, structure, or capability, that‚Äôs likely me integrating a new tool, pattern, or AI-assisted refactor that‚Äôs already been stress-tested offline.
* This isn‚Äôt just about code; it‚Äôs about showing the process. The good, the bad, the ‚Äúman plans / God laughs‚Äù moments ‚Äî all part of the package.
