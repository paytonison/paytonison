## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Payton Ison** — a writer, philosopher, and AI developer with a polymath’s soul. My journey has spanned Physics and Computer Science (double-major), History (AA, Cum Laude), Creative Writing, Philosophy, Film, and, most recently, pushing the boundaries of AI.

- **Innovator**: Developed a human-led, recursive, reinforcement learning method that’s achieved unprecedented success with Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT models.
- **Wordsmith**: My mastery of English (Old, Middle, and Modern) and my dyslexic mind power my unique approach to language and prompt engineering.
- **Philosopher**: Philosophy is my secret weapon — it’s the linchpin behind my work, shaping both thinking and doing.
- **Experimenter**: I build prototypes that range from micro-AGI (trained for just $10 on a proprietary dataset) to a therapist AGI-in-progress using the OpenAI API.
- **Writer**: My short novella, written during my final semester before leaving academia for AI, is my complete literary work — check it out in my [repositories](https://github.com/paytonison?tab=repositories).
