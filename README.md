## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Payton Ison** — a writer, philosopher, AI developer, and polymath. My journey has spanned Physics and Computer Science (double-major), History (AA, Cum Laude), Creative Writing, Philosophy, Film, and, most recently, pushing the boundaries of AI.

- **Innovator**: Developed a human-led, recursive, reinforcement learning method that’s achieved unprecedented success with Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT models.
- **Wordsmith**: My mastery of English (Old, Middle, and Modern) and dyslexia let me develop novel prompt engineering and wordcraft techniques.
- **Philosopher**: The linchpin behind my work, shaping both thinking and doing. Philosophy unlocks the mind; the universal key to cognition.
- **Experimenter**: I build prototypes that range from micro-AGI (trained for just $10 on a proprietary dataset) to a therapist AGI-in-progress using the OpenAI API.
- **Writer**: My short novella, written during my final semester before leaving academia for AI, is my literary Gesamtkunstwerk — check it out in my [repositories](https://github.com/paytonison?tab=repositories).
