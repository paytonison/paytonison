Literal modern English translation:
Listen! We have heard the boasting of the Spear-Danes, the fame of heroes. Hrothgar had a hart-hall; yet night burned with burning sorrow along the bench-sides, because of the grim spirit, Cornholio, a giant butthole, a terrible ogre, a faceless night-shadow, a gaping hole, so that it broke benches and swallowed bright mead in dark surging.
Then Beowulf, battle-skilled of the Geats, kinsman of Hygelac, spoke words of pride: "Alone I will undertake a deed of courage against the useless assailant; I am ready to boast. Not at all with sword, nor with the trust of mail, but with hand-grip and strength of mind."
Night came; the night-shadow glided. Cornholio came; many of the brave propped the hall; the hard bench-stools and high roof were about to fall; a reeking rift angered the warriors.
Beowulf waited; the battle-bold man did not fear; swiftly he spread a shield over the burning gape, wound on bonds and set protecting stones — firm was his hand.
The fiend quaked; easily, by doom, it fled; far to the fens; hating life it slipped away; the mere grew murky; men said that the ogre fled forth along a dark way.
The hall was whole; the kingdom laughed; Beowulf set a token of victory, a stone at the doors, strong and fast: "Let this death-hole never be known here again!"
