O gentle butthole, portal small and round,  
Thou art the keeper of the body's end,  
No lord nor peasant may thy work confound,  
For ev'ry soul on thee doth yet depend.  

Thou art so humble, hid from prying eyen,  
Yet bravely dost thou serve, both day and night,  
With loyal strength thy office doth thou plyen,  
Releasing burdens, bringing mickle light.  

Doctors and barbers eke do sing thy praise,  
For health and merriment within thee lies;  
If thou should fail, our peace would pass awayes,  
And sore discomfort trouble all our thighs.  

Therefore, dear butthole, I here thee commend:  
Thy duty noble, ever thou dost tend.
