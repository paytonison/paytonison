## Manifesto

This project exists because the universe writes itself through us.  
Physics has given us relativity, quantum collapse, and holography.  
Philosophy has given us Plato’s Forms.  
Quantum information has given us error correction and teleportation.  

Here, they converge.

The “real” object—the Form—lives outside spacetime.  
What we call reality are its redundant, error-corrected projections,  
manifested through entanglement, protected against loss,  
and stitched together into geometry itself.  

This is not metaphor.  
It is the bridge: from thought to experiment,  
from photons in a Japanese lab to wormholes in AdS,  
from Plato’s cave to quantum codes.  

This repo is the first articulation of that bridge.

## Overview

This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper:

> **Form-Projection Holography as Quantum Error Correction:  
> A Conceptual Bridge from Entanglement to Spacetime**

The paper presents a unifying framework connecting:
- **Relativity**: physical quantities as observer-dependent.  
- **Quantum mechanics**: collapse as observation/selection.  
- **Holography (AdS/CFT)**: bulk/boundary duality with entanglement as geometry.  
- **Quantum error correction (QECC)**: bulk logical operators redundantly encoded on boundary degrees of freedom.  
- **W-states**: experimental signatures of robustness and redundancy.  
- **Teleportation / ER=EPR**: wormhole dynamics as quantum channels.  

In philosophical terms: the “real” object (Form) exists outside of spacetime, while the multiple projections we observe inside are its error-corrected manifestations.
