## Overview

This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper:

> **Form-Projection Holography as Quantum Error Correction:  
> A Conceptual Bridge from Entanglement to Spacetime**

The paper presents a unifying framework connecting:
- **Relativity**: physical quantities as observer-dependent.  
- **Quantum mechanics**: collapse as observation/selection.  
- **Holography (AdS/CFT)**: bulk/boundary duality with entanglement as geometry.  
- **Quantum error correction (QECC)**: bulk logical operators redundantly encoded on boundary degrees of freedom.  
- **W-states**: experimental signatures of robustness and redundancy.  
- **Teleportation / ER=EPR**: wormhole dynamics as quantum channels.  

In philosophical terms: the “real” object (Form) exists outside of spacetime, while the multiple projections we observe inside are its error-corrected manifestations.
