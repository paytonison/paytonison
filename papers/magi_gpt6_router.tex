\begin{abstract}
We present \textbf{Magi $\times$ GPT-6}, a hyper-reasoning router that composes a small controller (\emph{Gate}), three specialized experts (\emph{Magi-A/B/C}), a lightweight \emph{Judge} (arbiter), and an optional \emph{Canon} model into a single, cost-aware inference system. The Gate classifies tasks, budgets tokens, and selects experts; the experts answer in parallel under a unified JSON schema; a constrained micro-debate resolves disagreements; the Judge fuses candidates into a single answer with calibrated confidence; and escalation to Canon is triggered only when uncertainty or risk exceeds thresholds. The design unifies conditional computation (MoE/Switch), tool-augmented reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, and LLM-as-Judge into an end-to-end architecture with explicit \emph{evidence objects} and \emph{uncertainty vectors}. We provide a formal cost model, deployment notes targeting \emph{H200} GPUs, and a reproducible evaluation protocol measuring both answer quality and \emph{token-normalized} efficiency.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Scaling language model capability by densifying parameters quickly encounters prohibitive inference cost. Conditional computation and routing promise capacity without commensurate FLOPs by activating only relevant experts per input. While token-level MoE layers expand capacity within a single network, many real-world applications benefit from \emph{system-level routing} across heterogeneous skills (logic/math/code, retrieval-heavy analysis, and editorial/creative refinement).

We propose \textbf{Magi $\times$ GPT-6}, a practical hyper-reasoning router that: (i) selects a subset of specialized experts under explicit token and risk budgets; (ii) compels experts to emit structured \emph{evidence}; (iii) resolves conflicts with a short, bounded micro-debate; (iv) fuses results via a lightweight Judge; and (v) escalates to an optional large Canon model only when necessary. The result is a tractable quality--cost Pareto on commodity H200 nodes.

\paragraph{Contributions.}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
  \item A unified JSON schema for expert outputs (answer, rationale, uncertainty vector, evidence list, timing).
  \item A micro-debate protocol and Judge that fuse multiple candidates into one answer with calibrated confidence.
  \item A cost-aware router that escalates to a large Canon model only when uncertainty or risk exceeds thresholds.
  \item A \emph{reproducible evaluation protocol} reporting accuracy, citation validity, pass@k, escalation rate, and token-normalized latency/cost on standard benchmarks.
  \item A deployment recipe for H200-class GPUs using SDPA/Flash attention backends.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
\textbf{Conditional computation and MoE} (\cite{shazeer2017moe, fedus2021switch}) demonstrate compute-efficient scaling via token-wise expert routing. \textbf{MRKL-style} modular systems route to symbolic tools and knowledge sources (\cite{karpas2022mrkl}). \textbf{Reason-and-act} and \textbf{tool use} (e.g., ReAct, Toolformer, Program-of-Thoughts) interleave reasoning with tool calls (\cite{yao2023react, schick2023toolformer, chen2022program}). \textbf{RAG} reduces hallucinations by conditioning on retrieved documents (\cite{lewis2020rag}). \textbf{Self-reflection} and \textbf{LLM-as-Judge} improve reliability and evaluation (\cite{shinn2023reflexion, zheng2023judge}). Our work integrates these paradigms into a single controller--experts--judge architecture with explicit evidence tracking and uncertainty calibration.

\section{System Overview}
\subsection{Components}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=3pt]
  \item \textbf{Gate (Brainstem)}: small controller (7--13B) that classifies the task (\texttt{math|code|research|creative|mixed}), predicts hardness/risk, allocates token/temperature budgets, and selects experts.
  \item \textbf{Magi-A (Logic/Math/Code)}: tool-using; must provide runnable code/tests or arithmetic checks when applicable; refuses speculation.
  \item \textbf{Magi-B (Knowledge/Analysis)}: retrieval-first; emits citations and evidence; penalizes ungrounded claims.
  \item \textbf{Magi-C (Creative/Refactor)}: clarity, style, and counterfactual framing without altering verified facts.
  \item \textbf{Judge (Arbiter)}: small model (3--7B) that fuses candidates via rules prioritizing evidence and test results; emits \texttt{\{final, why, confidence\}}.
  \item \textbf{Canon (Optional)}: large model (e.g., 120B in MXFP4) invoked only when confidence is low or risk is high.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unified Expert Schema}
Every expert returns the following JSON object:
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  "answer": "...",
  "rationale": "...(<= 10 lines)...",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "uncertainty": {"calc": 0.0, "facts": 0.0, "speculation": 0.0},
  "evidence": [
    {"type":"tool","name":"python","result":"tests passed: 12/12"},
    {"type":"retrieval","source":"URL-or-doc-id","snippet":"..."}
  ],
  "timing_ms": 0
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Micro-Debate Protocol}
If candidates materially disagree: \textbf{Round 1} (64 tokens each): A asserts claim + test/evidence; B counters with sources. \textbf{Round 2} (64 tokens each): a single concession or refutation each. Judge decides; if still ambiguous and impact high, escalate to Canon.

\section{Routing Logic and Objective}
\paragraph{Objective.} Given input $x$, Gate selects expert set $E \subseteq \{A,B,C\}$ and budgets $b$ to minimize expected token cost while meeting quality and risk constraints:
\begin{equation}
\min_{E,b,\text{debate}} \ \mathbb{E}[T_{\text{total}}] \quad \text{s.t.}\quad \Pr(\text{err}(x) \le \epsilon) \ge 1-\delta,\ \ \rho(x) \le \rho_{\max}.
\end{equation}
Expected total tokens:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[T_{\text{total}}] = T_{\text{gate}} + \sum_{e \in E} T_{e} + T_{\text{judge}} + p_{\text{debate}} T_{\text{debate}} + p_{\text{esc}} T_{\text{canon}}.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Calibration.} The Judge maps expert uncertainties to a calibrated confidence $\hat{c}\in[0,1]$. The Gate updates its escalation threshold $\tau$ online via bandit feedback against pass@k, citation-validity, and test success.

\section{Implementation Details (H200-Oriented)}
\paragraph{Backends.} Use PyTorch SDPA with Flash-style kernels on Hopper-class GPUs; enable backend selection at runtime. Keep several GiB of headroom to avoid allocator thrash during parallel expert runs.

\paragraph{Placement (2$\times$H200).} GPU0: Gate, Judge, Magi-A. GPU1: Magi-B, Magi-C. Canon loads lazily on first escalation and can share GPU1. Use left-padding and batching to run experts in parallel under tight token budgets.

\paragraph{Prompts (System Snippets).}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
  \item \textbf{Magi-A}: ``Derive $\rightarrow$ verify with python/tests; refuse speculation; return schema exactly.''
  \item \textbf{Magi-B}: ``Propose 2--4 searches; ground claims with citations; summarize then answer; return schema.''
  \item \textbf{Magi-C}: ``Clarify or refactor; preserve verified facts; offer alt framings if confidence $<0.6$; return schema.''
  \item \textbf{Judge}: ``Fuse candidates; prefer verifiable evidence; penalize uncited claims; one micro-debate max; output \{\texttt{final, why, confidence}\}.''
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Protocol}
\paragraph{Benchmarks.} Math/Logic: GSM8K; Code: HumanEval; Knowledge/Analysis: MMLU, GPQA. Report accuracy or pass@k as appropriate.

\paragraph{System Metrics.} (medians with IQR) Escalation rate $p_{\text{esc}}$; token-normalized latency; evidence validity (fraction of claims with supporting sources); test success (Magi-A unit tests); Judge agreement with human raters on open-ended tasks.

\paragraph{Ablations.} Remove micro-debate; vary debate budget (32--128). Disable Magi-C to measure clarity/readability impact. Sweep Gate threshold $\tau$ to trace quality--cost Pareto. Swap retrieval backends to measure citation drift.

\section{Safety, Alignment, and Governance}
We add input/output guardrails before the Gate and after the Judge/Canon. Sensitive domains (health/legal/finance) require higher confidence thresholds and stricter debate limits. The Judge records uncertainty vectors and evidence for post-hoc auditing. Magi-A degrades gracefully on tooling failures (timeouts, resource caps).

\section{Limitations}
Judge bias and calibration remain challenging; retrieval quality does not equal truth; tool sandboxes can be brittle; routing errors can starve tasks of the right expertise. We mitigate via diversity- and authority-weighted retrieval, strict evidence requirements, and logging of near-misses to refine the Gate classifier.

\section{Discussion and Outlook}
System-level routing---not only architectural sparsity---can deliver reliable quality at low marginal cost by \emph{spending tokens where they matter}. Future work: jointly learn Gate and Judge with test-time optimal compute, integrate symbolic verifiers for more domains, and extend to multimodal pipelines (image/audio) under the same schema.

\paragraph{Ethics Statement.} We discuss potential misuse (automated misinformation, unsafe tool calls) and outline mitigations (guardrails, human-in-the-loop for high-risk domains).
