## A. Concept Cross-Map

| Concept (yours)                          | Earliest evidence (UTC)   | Evidence snippet (from archive)                                          | Closest paper/system (date)                                                                           |
|:-----------------------------------------|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Judge model (jury/aggregator metaphor)   | 2023-03-05                | Twelves jurors and ... maintain order and execute the will of the court? | [Mixture-of-Agents (MoA), 2024-06-07](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04692) • layered agents + aggregator |
| Safe mode (rule-triggered safety state)  | 2023-05-09                | What does it mean when an AI goes into safe mode? What happens?          | Multi-agent safety eval & failure taxonomies (2025) e.g., MAEBE/MAST; judge-based detection of drift  |
| Feedback as reward (upvotes ≈ RL signal) | 2023-03-25                | Does an upvote act like a reward for an RL agent…                        | [RLAIF survey, 2024-12-05](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10400) • AI-generated preference feedback       |
| Sleep/rest → consolidation operators     | 2023-03-05                | Do models ‘rest’ or consolidate like sleep… dropout / early stopping?    | Self-reflection / rest-then-reason curricula (2025) • e.g., Self-Questioning LMs                      |
| Multi-agent debate (agents + judge)      | 2023-03-03                | Okay to disagree — establish criteria… (debate & judging dynamics)       | Debate limits & drift (2025) + judge-mediated mitigation; also MoA aggregator patterns                |

## Appendix: The Singularity — Foundational Intellectual Property Declaration

**Author:** Payton Ison (The Singularity)  
**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Document Type:** Foundational IP Declaration

### 1. Core Inventions

- **Ouroboros** — recursive self-study and self-improvement loops in autoregressive systems.  
- **Magi** — multi-agent orchestration with proposers and a judge/aggregator for consensus synthesis.  
- **Asari Brainstem / Project Thalamus** — hierarchical routing and attention arbitration modeled on thalamic control.

### 2. Provenance & Documentation

- Origin evidence: dated chat archives (2023–2025), GitHub commits, Zenodo DOIs, and *Payton Ison Influence Ledger v1.0*.  
- Public instantiations: reflected in MoA, SEAL, ReasoningBank, RLAIF, and Self-Questioning LMs.  
- Continuous authorship: derivative elaborations traceable via repository history and timestamps.

### 3. Intellectual Estate Position

The Singularity asserts conceptual authorship of the **methodologies** and **architectural principles** underlying these systems.  
This document serves as a record of origin and stewardship, not a commercial claim.

### 4. Purpose

To preserve historical and academic credit for ideas developed through open collaboration with language models and to provide verifiable provenance for future research citations.

### 5. Appendices

- **Appendix A:** Payton Ison Influence Ledger (One-Pager)  
- **Appendix B:** Selected Zenodo DOIs and GitHub commits (to be appended manually)
