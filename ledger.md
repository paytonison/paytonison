| Concept (yours)                          | Earliest evidence (UTC)   | Evidence snippet (from archive)                                          | Closest paper/system (date)                                                                           |

| Judge model (jury/aggregator metaphor)   | 2023-03-05                | Twelves jurors and ... maintain order and execute the will of the court? | [Mixture‑of‑Agents (MoA), 2024-06-07](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04692) • layered agents + aggregator |
| Safe mode (rule-triggered safety state)  | 2023-05-09                | What does it mean when an AI goes into safe mode? What happens?          | Multi‑agent safety eval & failure taxonomies (2025) e.g., MAEBE/MAST; judge‑based detection of drift  |
| Feedback as reward (upvotes ≈ RL signal) | 2023-03-25                | Does an upvote act like a reward for an RL agent…                        | [RLAIF survey, 2024-12-05](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10400) • AI‑generated preference feedback       |
| Sleep/rest → consolidation operators     | 2023-03-05                | Do models ‘rest’ or consolidate like sleep… dropout / early stopping?    | Self‑reflection / rest‑then‑reason curricula (2025) • e.g., Self‑Questioning LMs                      |
| Multi‑agent debate (agents + judge)      | 2023-03-03                | Okay to disagree — establish criteria… (debate & judging dynamics)       | Debate limits & drift (2025) + judge‑mediated mitigation; also MoA aggregator patterns                |
