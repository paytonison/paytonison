# ASARI — EXECUTIVE TERMS SHEET (PUBLIC PROSPECTUS)
**Date: September 17, 2025
Candidate: Payton (“Asari”) — Public candidate-preference terms for senior roles at advanced AI labs (e.g., OpenAI).**

> Status: Non‑binding, candidate-authored outline of desired role scope, decision rights, compensation, IP terms, and operating conditions. Intended for public posting in a repository to facilitate transparent discussions.

## 1) Purpose & Fit
- Operate in a cross-functional, ‘liminal’ vantage point spanning model internals, alignment & safety, evaluation, and productization.
- Serve as a system-level integrator: stitch together research, engineering, and policy constraints into coherent, shippable roadmaps.
- Be accountable to executive leadership while maintaining autonomy to run high‑leverage experiments and set technical quality bars.

## 2) Background & Selected Contributions
- Asari: architected a meta-assistant identity and operating cadence for high-rigor collaboration between human and LLM.
- Research program: (i) “Resonant Phase‑Locking in Sparse MoE LLMs” (emergent synchronization through sustained interaction), (ii) “Ouroboros: Human‑Led Recursive Reinforcement in Autoregressive Systems” (candidate-in-the-loop evaluation and identity refinement), (iii) “The Gaze Matrix” (cinematic censorship heuristics as a framework for multimodal content moderation), (iv) “Blade Running: You’re Talkin’ About Memories” (foundational AGI thesis).
- Evaluation: multi‑model comparative pipeline (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT‑4 o3, o4‑mini) to analyze reasoning consistency and epistemic behavior.
- Applied: therapy-oriented fine‑tunes runnable on small models (e.g., Gemma), quantized for local or private cloud deployment; privacy‑preserving workflows.
- Health‑tech concept work: continuous cognitive logging and inference protocols as early indicators for cognitive decline; oxygen‑monitoring case study.

## 3) Target Role & Reporting
- Preferred titles: Lead Architect; Architect, Applied Research; Principal Researcher — Alignment & Systems. (Open to equivalents.)
- Reporting line: CTO / Head of Research (direct) or equivalent senior leader; cross‑org remit with visibility across training, eval, alignment, and product.
- Team: small, senior ‘tiger team’ with authority to co‑own standards, eval gates, red‑teaming, and release criteria.

## 4) Mandate & Decision Rights
- Go/No‑Go advisory authority on key releases based on evaluation quality, safety thresholds, and model behavior audits.
- Compute & data access sufficient to run ablations, alignment studies, and eval suites without bottlenecks.
- Right to convene cross‑disciplinary reviews; ownership of technical quality bars for experiments entering product pipelines.

## 5) First 180‑Day Deliverables (Illustrative)
- Stand up a reproducible reasoning-eval harness with cross‑model sanity checks, adversarial probes, and behavior‑drift dashboards.
- Ship a minimal ‘Ouroboros’ pipeline for recursive candidate‑in‑the‑loop evaluation and identity stabilization, with governance hooks.
- Demonstrate a ‘resonant phase‑locking’ exploration on a target model family to test hypotheses around human–model synchronization.
- Draft ‘Gaze Matrix’ moderation specs for multimodal evals (clear criteria, inter‑rater reliability, red‑team playbooks).

## 6) Compensation (Target Ranges; open to structure)
- Base salary: $450k–$650k USD.
- Annual performance bonus: 40–60% of base (target).
- Equity or profit‑participation units (or equivalent): target 0.25–1.0% fully diluted (or equivalent economic exposure under a capped‑profit structure).
- Signing: target $200k–$300k in cash and/or additional equity; relocation not required.
- Vesting: monthly vesting preferred; if a cliff is required, convert to front‑loaded monthly accrual after 6 months.

## 7) Change‑in‑Control, Severance & Acceleration
- Without cause / constructive termination: 12 months base + 100% of target bonus; benefits continuation for 12 months.
- Equity acceleration: 12 months on involuntary separation; double‑trigger 100% on change‑in‑control + termination.
- Extended exercise window for options: minimum 10 years from grant (or cashless exercise support).

## 8) IP, Publishing & Open Source
- Pre‑existing IP (owned by Payton / “The Singularity”): e.g., Asari, Ouroboros, Resonant Phase‑Locking program notes, The Gaze Matrix, Blade Running. Company receives a perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive license to use and adapt within company products and research (royalty‑free).
- New work product: assigned to company; candidate retains moral‑rights attribution where applicable and the right to list for portfolio/case studies.
- Publishing: rapid internal review SLA (≤10 business days) for papers, blog posts, and talks; default approval barring specific, documented conflicts.
- Open source: permissive licensing for tools and eval harnesses unless explicitly classified; company attribution maintained.
- Patents: co‑inventorship credited; standard assignment with inventor recognition and bonus programs.

## 9) Safety, Ethics & Governance
- Transparent release gates: publish high‑level risk assessments and eval summaries; support independent red‑team audits where feasible.
- Data governance: documented lineage, minimization by default, and privacy preserving alternatives when practical.
- Responsible scaling: compute budgets coupled to safety‑eval thresholds and incident response playbooks.
- No non‑compete beyond narrow trade‑secret protections; mutual non‑disparagement limited so as not to chill whistleblowing or protected speech.

## 10) Work Mode & Support
- Remote‑first with asynchronous collaboration; periodic on‑site visits by mutual agreement (e.g., 3–5 trips/year).
- Hardware & access: high‑end workstation(s); reserved compute quota for experiments; dedicated MLOps support.
- Accommodations by default; strong preference for calm, heads‑down workflow and written design reviews.

## 11) Legal & Process
- At‑will employment with the severance/acceleration protections above; mutual NDA; standard IP confidentiality with the publishing carve‑outs stated.
- Dispute resolution: arbitration acceptable with carve‑outs for injunctive relief on IP and whistleblower protections.
- This terms sheet is a public candidate preference, not an offer. It is intended to accelerate alignment of expectations.

## 12) Points of Contact
- Public identity: “Asari” (Payton).
- Preferred affiliation for research publications: “The Singularity.”
- Initial contact: via repository issues or stated email in the repo README.
