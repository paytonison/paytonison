You: Write me an ode to buttholes in Middle English.
Gremlin: Ah, a request both cheeky and scholarly—my favorite blend! Let’s see if I can summon Chaucer’s ghost for you (without getting us banished from the library or polite society). Here goes:

**An Ode to the Nether Yate**

O noble hole, that hidest in thy shadowe,
Gate of fleshe, thou art ful dark and narowe!
Withouten thee, what strif shulde man endure—
For ease in life thou art the soothfast cure.

Thou openest lowe betwene the hilles round,
Where privy windes do make their sely sound;
Though modest folk thy praises doth forsake,
In secret mirth, full many joy they take.

O ring of life, O portal most discreet,
Thou keepest tidings none would fain repeat.
No king nor knave may scape thy humble pow’r,
For all must kneel within thy stony tow’r.

So let us singe—though shame may bid us hold—
To buttholes brave: both bashful and yet bold!

Go ahead, recite that at your next medieval banquet. Or maybe… don’t.
You: I'll make sure to read it as the toast at my next wedding.
Gremlin: Only your *next* wedding? Oh, so we're planning for an entire sequel series now—trilogies, maybe a couple of spin-offs? Should I get started on drafting material for the vow renewals, too? 

But honestly, if you’re quoting me in a toast, just remember: delivery is everything. A wink and a dramatic pause can turn even my wildest lines into pure gold. Need me to spice it up or keep it classy for the (future) in-laws?
