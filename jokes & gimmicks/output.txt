LITERAL MODERN ENGLISH TRANSLATION

Listen! I heard at Heorot, the ring-hall resounding,
that King Hrothgar guarded the hall;
but night-evil did not cease, men turned from sleeping,
because the cruel oppressor Cornholio came,
the giant butthole, full of murderous deeds,
a rim-ring fate-wright, fierce and eager to swallow.
It heaved in the hall, the benches boomed,
the bright light shone, but shadow came,
dark under the sky; the horn-gables roared,
the minds of warriors bent; the fiend howled.

Often he swallowed the mead-seat’s company,
the strong, a rage of sucking, he gulps down warriors
sitting among treasure; they were not satisfied,
but the thirsty ogre had boundless need.
About this the sea-faring, lord of the Geats,
Beowulf the man, a battle-warrior,
learned from the shore, his spirit stirred:
“I will end these foolish crimes with deeds,
against this ring-hallowed shelter I shall have
a hand-grip with the spirit, the hell-worker’s life.”

So the earl swore, sent back the message,
sat to his sea-wood, raised sail up,
the whale-road hurried, quickly he came;
bright board-wood, the brine-path sprang.
Then was Heorot’s ring-hall joyful,
men gathered in strength, mead flowing;
Beowulf boasted, he cared not for rings:
“By no means will I turn to sword’s way nor to seax,
against that ring-thing will I shield with warriors;
with hands I bring courage and hero-craft.”

Night was dark, the Savior silent,
sleep sat down, and the poet was quiet;
then came under the clouds, the cry-fast spirit,
Cornholio dark, creeping alive around,
ring-rim bellowing, its breast all hunger,
a long air-suck, hateful toward the praise-hall.
Then Beowulf sprang up, bold in battle, the Geat,
stood alone, a comfort to earls;
he grasped the oncoming spirit fiercely,
caught at the body of that ring-lip.

There was clamour in the hall, jewelry clanged,
the benches broke, gold rings shone;
then the battle-man brandished, the man unafraid,
tore that rim-edge, a rend with strength,
broke through its bindings; no blood flowed there,
but the evil-doer lost its ring-shelter,
the helm of its ring-lip, its heart laid open.
Then the ogre departed, trembling, sorely afflicted,
sought the fen-slopes, life ebbing,
mindful of murder, abandoned by hands.

Day sprang up; the horns resounded;
the men had a gift of joy in hand:
the straight ring-rim, torn at the end,
Beowulf bore to the arch beneath the gable,
hung it in the hall, a shelter against gold,
a true token of the monster’s defeat.
Then Hrothgar the protector, leaning on a corselet,
spoke long words of praise, peace to his people:
“Never was there such a thing, since I ruled,
that the rim-swallow left our rest!”

The man then bold in boast spoke for gift-giving,
glory in deeds for the days of his life:
they told in song-sound, the poets said,
how Beowulf’s hand broke the ring-rim,
killed Cornholio, cut off every killing-deed,
gave a check to destruction, withstood sudden disaster.
So the shelter-hall, Hrothgar’s home,
was protected in spirit, released from enemies;
the butt-hole’s byrnie, named Cornholio,
did not come again, but was locked in defeat.
